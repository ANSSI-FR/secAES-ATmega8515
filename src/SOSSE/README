SOSSE is documented inside the source. Printable/browsable documentation
is generated with doxygen. A "make" in the top level directory will
also build the documentation. If you do not have doxygen installed and
do not want to install it, you find the most important documentation in
"src/main.h". You can also browse it online at:

**UPDATED**

While researching smart card technology I came across this great
environment (SOSSE) and realized it needed some cleaning and updating,
since the last release was back in 2003. Now, in 2012, I made some
changes and I'm putting up on GitHub so we can continue updating and
making it great! 

Email me with any questions: <q@crypto.com>

Check out TODO in rootdir for list of modifications made to 2003 release
and for future updates.
